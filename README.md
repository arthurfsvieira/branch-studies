## GitHub Branches and Merge

In this lesson I'll learn more about how to create a branch and how to merge to main after all the alterations.

First, we created the main branch with the basics of HTML5. Without any content.

So, aftert that we created the full content of the page. H1, paragrafs, etc. And merged into the main branch.

We also created a branch for the design, creating the assets folder and a style.css file. And merged into the main branch.

But befeore we finish the merge, a conflict appears, so we have to resolve that.

Comparing the code (content and design), we opted by design one and finally merge into the main branch.
